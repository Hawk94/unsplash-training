Your Task:
Your task is to use the skeleton components and their descriptions to create a unsplash image viewer. This is a simple web application that gives users the ability to pull random unsplash images using the unsplash api. Metadata about these images is displayed when a user hovers over them.

The design for this web application can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1D0SWWMGqGHxn1eFNNFHD59J3RDeL0Hjf

Component skeletons can be found in the components folder. In order to style the application use component level css files.

When styling the grid have a look at css grids to get the right autoflow of cards.

Any questions ask away...
